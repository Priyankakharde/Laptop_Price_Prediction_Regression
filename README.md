💻 Laptop Price Predictor using Machine Learning
This project predicts the price of a laptop based on its specifications like RAM, processor, storage, screen size, etc. It uses Python and Machine Learning (Linear Regression or Random Forest) to build a predictive model.

📌 Project Objective
To build a machine learning model that can predict the price of a laptop using its configuration. This can help users or retailers estimate the price of laptops based on their features.

🛠️ Technologies Used
Python

Pandas

NumPy

Scikit-learn

Matplotlib / Seaborn (for visualization)

Streamlit (if deployed as web app)

⚙️ How It Works
Data Collection: A dataset of laptop specifications and prices is collected (in .csv format).

Preprocessing:

Handle missing values

Convert categorical columns using LabelEncoder or OneHotEncoding

Normalize features if needed

Model Training:

Split the dataset into training and test sets

Train using LinearRegression or RandomForestRegressor

Evaluate model using metrics like R² score or MAE

Prediction: Predict the price of a laptop based on user input features.

(Optional) Deployment: Use Streamlit to create a simple web interface for the model.

📈 Example Input Features
Brand: Dell, HP, Lenovo

Processor: i5, i7, Ryzen 5, etc.

RAM: 8GB, 16GB

Storage: HDD/SSD (256GB, 512GB)

Screen Size: 14", 15.6"

Operating System: Windows, macOS

🔮 Example Output
Predicted Price: ₹52,000
